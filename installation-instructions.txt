This plugin will be uploaded to the Ubercart modules site, but the latest version will always be available at: 
https://github.com/FeeFighters/samurai-uber-cart. When used from github please notice that the PHP library
is incorporated as a git submodule so you must run git submodule init; git submodule update to pull it down.

This integration of X-Cart into the Samurai payment gateway uses the Server To Server method of integration.
